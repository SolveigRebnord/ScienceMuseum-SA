            For every sunday, there’s something new to explore! <br><br>

            We want to combine a group of young, aspring to-be-stars for sundays filled with friends and learning of the highest tier. Each sunday for 8 weeks we will have a new subject, or a new field to explore. <br><br>

            For us, it is important to have fun and engange, but our goal is also to teach our visitors how to use science and wisdom to do good. Sustainability is crucial, and we want to teach them the mindset of implementing their knowledge to do good choices. No matter if they are going to space, finding the cure for decises or building a time machine. <br><br>

            Icluded in memebership: <br><br>

            * A workshop/activity every sunday 10am - 14pm for 8 weeks in total <br><br>

            * Filling lunch/dinner pluss drinks + snacks <br><br>

            * Everything included no matter the activity or workshop, 
            and of course you get to bring home everything you make! <br><br>

            Our activity is aimed to be for children only, but parents are of course welcome to stay at the musuem, have a coffee in the café or engage if needed. <br><br>
